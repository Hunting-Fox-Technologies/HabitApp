# HabitApp
This is the HabitApp Project

The Project Coding Guideline is as follow :

1.- Name each .swift File according to the Mockup Name, for example the Settings Mockup Page should be called "Settings.swift"
2.-When pushing the code, make sure to push only the .swift File


Work Stages :


1.Sprint : UI Design
==>We will first work on recreating the UI according to the MockUp

->Michael : Settings  
->Yoon    : SplashScreen , Home
->Dennis  : Ideas
->Brandon : Create 

2.Sprint : Basic Functionalities
==>We will work on recreating each individual fucntionality on a basic level per page assigned,for isntance, the activation of the stilish of button(when
i press a button it should change its color, or when i tap on a writting box it should allow me to write on it)

->Michael : Settings  
->Yoon    : SplashScreen , Home
->Dennis  : Ideas
->Brandon : Create 

3.Sprint : Transitions 
==>We will work on transitoning each page to the other, for instance on the Home page, the plus sign button should take us to the Create page, the gear button
should take us to the Settings Page and so on.
